# Movie_Recommender-HCI-
Movie Recommender app created for the course of Human Computer Interaction for Bachelors of Science in Artificial Intelligence from VU Amsterdam

With the advent of multiple streaming services at everyone’s fingertips, the average
consumer is spoilt for choice when it comes to seeking their viewing pleasure. This has led to
another problem; actually, choosing what they want to watch. In order to solve this
problem, we have created a prototype of a mobile movie recommendation application, with
a focus on easing the decision-making process of choosing a movie, as well as having the
secondary ability of bringing attention to movies beyond a viewer’s usual comfort zone. The
evaluation of the aforementioned concept was designed in the form of a python coded
interface as well as an online questionnaire. The aim of this research proposal is to assess
the current usability and appearance of the existing user interface. The information gathered
from this investigation will then go on to improve the existing UI, with as many user
suggestions incorporated into the final product as possible.
